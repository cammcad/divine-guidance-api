"The number 3 can signify a goddess’s presence, especially when the 3 follows a 1 as in a 13 arrangement. This is because 13 relates to the annual number of moon cycles, and the moon is associated with feminine spirituality."
"The combination of 1’s and 3’s asks you to surrender your goals and desires to spirit, and ask for guidance in regards to what is to manifest in your life. The Universe is aware of where you are at in your life, and want to help and assist you along your path."
"1's and 3's indicates that the Ascended Masters are working with you on your thought processes to enable you to make the highest and wisest choices. They are sending you positive energy to keep you from feeling discouraged. They are also sending encouragement to stay focused on the true goals of your soul, so that you are able to succeed in your life purpose and in life in general."
"Additionally, the Ascended Masters may be offering you advice, guidance and suggestions on your life's purpose if you are questioning your current pathway. If you are unsure of your next move or what action to take, specifically ask the Ascended Masters for their assistance."
