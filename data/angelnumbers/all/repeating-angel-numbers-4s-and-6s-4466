"When the 4 and 6 number combination repeats in your life it is an indication that your angels are cautioning you that your focus is too much on the material world.  You may be loosing sight of your life purpose as worries and anxieties overtake your thoughts.  Your angels ask you to ‘let go’ of these worries as they are hindering the flow of positive energy."
"Your angels ask you to surrender your worries to them in order for them to be able to intervene on your behalf to help ease your situation."
