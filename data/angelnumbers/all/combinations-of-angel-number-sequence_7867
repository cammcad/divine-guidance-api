"The 1 and 6 combination is a message from your angels to keep your thoughts 'heavenward' and positive, and to let go of material matters or concerns. The focus is on emotions, family issues, the home environment and you as a person. New energies will be entering your life which will lead to a renewed enthusiasm. The angels are sending you positive energy and balance so that you are able to stay focused on your path."
"A 611 combination is telling you to ask for help in repairing or readjusting something in the material world that may be hindering or bothering you and causing anxiety. This may have to do with unresolved debt or a purchase or attainment of something of importance that you are unable to afford at present. It may also be pertaining to a fear of loss. The angels ask you not to be disheartened but to maintain a positive frame of mind, as they are working hard behind the scenes to fulfill your needs. You are asked to remain receptive of the gifts of the Universe."
