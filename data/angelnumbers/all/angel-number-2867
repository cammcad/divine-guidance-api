"Angel Number 2867 tells you that in order to become fully aware of your true intuition and higher-awareness, you must first be aware of what is going on in your life in the here and now. The key to developing your intuition is to be fully aware and present in the moment so that you are able to ‘feel’ from moment to moment. It also allows you to observe the most obvious situations and tune into the more subtle, energetic aspects."
"Angel Number 2867 brings a message to focus upon what you can do and how you can overcome obstacles to accomplish more. Focus on the solution rather than the problem and do not let your fears control you. Face them head-on and take control of the way you live your life."
"Pay attention to the subtleties of life as well as the more obvious signs and synchronicities (or meaningful coincidences) that present for you. Look for life-changing opportunities that will arise just at the right time. Be aware of your surroundings and what is truly going on in your life. Take time for quiet contemplation, as through contemplation you are able to access your true self and hear your intuition. You are then able to live a richer and more fulfilled life. Clear your mind and allow inspiration to freely come to you."
