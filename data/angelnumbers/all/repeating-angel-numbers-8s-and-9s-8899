"When an 8 and 9 combination repeats, it is a message from your angels that a significant phase in your life has come to an end, or will do so soon. Other related and unrelated issues or situations will also draw to a close as a result."
"This number sequence is a message that you are going through a chain of events where many parts of your life are slowing and stopping.Â  This is happening for reasons which will become evident soon."
"The 8 and 9 combination is a powerful one, as the vibration of the number 8 has to do with strength, tenacity, ability and abundance, whilst the number 9 carries the attributes of 'the leader' and of the 'humanitarian'."
