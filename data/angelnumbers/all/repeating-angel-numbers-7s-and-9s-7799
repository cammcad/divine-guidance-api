"The repeated appearance of the 7 and 9 combination may be a message of congratulations to you.  You are to be commended. Your angels indicate that you are shedding old facets of your life that no longer suit who you are.  You are now living a more authentic life.  This number sequence applauds your choices to live with honesty, truth and integrity."
"7 is the vibration of our higher selves, our intuition and spirituality, whilst the number 9 energy is the 'humanitarian' and torchbearer who illuminates the way for others."
