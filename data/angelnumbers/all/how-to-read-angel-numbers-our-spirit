"*\tUsing and understanding Angelic Numerology or Angel numbers helps us to gain clarity and guidance from the angelic realm. The messages and meanings depicted within these pages are to be used as a guide only.  \tOur\tspirit guides\tand guardian angels guide us through our thoughts, our emotions, our insights and our actions.  Our guardians show us signs as a means of subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) getting our attention in order for them to be able to guide us.\tOne way that our\tangels\tattract our attention is by showing us physical signs, such as repeating number sequences, which can appear in all manner of places. Numbers are all around us in our everyday lives, so it is not difficult for the angels to arrange them in a fashion that we take notice of.\tWhen we recognize and interpret the repeating number sequences around us, we are able to feel more connected to our spirit guides and\tangels\t. This connection allows us to open the door to our inspiring and powerful connection to the angelic realm, which brings about clarity, hope, peace and love.\tInterpreting the messages and meanings of your Angel Numbers (or repetitive number sequences) is an effective way of recurring messages and insights from your guardian angels and\tspirit guides\t.\tInterpreting your Angel Numbers is a very personal undertaking, and to decipher them accurately you must use your own intuitive abilities. Just as each and every soul has its own unique vibration and energy, so too does the messages and meanings of your recurring number sequences. \tOften, when you see the numbers of your date of birth repeating to you, it is an indication that you are to concentrate and focus upon pursuing your true\tlife purpose\t... your reason \tfor being ... your\tsoul mission\t. \t*\tJoanne Walmsley\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t -  The Vibration and Energy of Numbers"
