"The Universe and your angels ask that you alter your thought-patterns, beliefs and/or mindset. Be aware that the solution or answer is within your own thoughts. You need to maintain a positive frame of mind in order to hear your angels clearly. Ask the angels to guide the direction of your thoughts and to support you during this transition. Listen out for their guidance and look out for the signs."
"Recurring 1’s and 0’s tells that you are receiving Divine guidance through your thoughts, ideas and ‘claircognizance’ (knowing facts without knowing how you received the information). The message is to remain positive about the messages you receive and act upon them for your own benefit. Only you and your angels really know what is right for you, so listen to your own intuition and inner-knowing. Your angels will plant thoughts and ideas into your mind to guide you along."
"The message of the number 100 is to remind you to keep your thoughts totally aligned with the Divine. Do not allow negative emotions or thoughts deter you from your spiritual path. Your positive thoughts and actions make a huge difference in your day to day life, and you are asked to keep your face to the light."
