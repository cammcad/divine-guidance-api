Number 0 relates to the Universal Energies and the ‘God force’ energy and stands for potential and/or choice, and brings a message to do with developing one’s spiritual aspects.  It suggests that you listen to your intuition and higher-self as this is where you will find all of your answers.  Number 4 brings its influences of practicality and application, hard work and responsibility, traditional values, honesty and integrity, diligence and determination to successfully achieve goals.  Number 4 also relates to our drive, passion and purpose and resonates with the energies of the Archangels."
