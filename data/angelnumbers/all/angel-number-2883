Ensure that you only think positive and uplifting thoughts, rather than negative thoughts or expectations. You get what you expect so make sure you radiate positive energies and expect the highest and best in return. Let go of old hurts, fears, habits and/or any negativity or regrets from the past that may be holding you back from living up to your full potential, as fear, worry and anxiety block your natural channels and angelic and intuitive messages and information become less easy to hear and interpret. Practice changing your inner-picture and replace fear and discord with forgiveness, love and inner-peace. Take ownership of your own life and discover your dreams. \tAngel Number 2883 encourages you to be compassionate towards others, regardless of their actions. Compassion is one of the greatest spiritual tools a\tlightworker\tpossesses. An intuitive soul can see through falsehoods and untruths, and can often see the real reason why someone needs to be dishonest and/or untruthful. Use compassion when dealing with others.\tNumber 2883 relates to\tnumber 3\t(2+8+8+3=21, 2+1=3) and\tAngel Number 3\t.\t*\tJoanne \tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers\tBODY SOUL MIND SPIRIT"
