"When 9’s and 1’s appear repeatedly, the angels are telling you that a new door has opened up for you, as a product of your positive thoughts, intentions and actions.  Make the most of this opportunity and walk forward with confidence and surety."
"9’s and 1’s appearing together indicates that your goal is almost complete, or that you are coming to the end of a phase or cycle in your life.  It is an indication that one door is closing and another is opening."
"The message is to allow the 'old' to be released so it is able to be replaced with 'new'."
