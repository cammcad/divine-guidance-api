"Angel Number 2928 encourages you to focus on the things in your life that nourish and support you, and let go of things that hinder you and hold you back. Release ties to situations, circumstances and even people who do not support you or your highest ideals. Trust yourself and your intuition and take action towards experiences where you are able to successfully lead, teach and heal others, but remain distant or disconnected from negative influences that can taint or drain your energies and lower your frequencies. Use your personal will and strong sense of self to raise and increase your personal vibration/s and direct your energies towards to the upliftment and enlightenment of yourself and others."
"Have a good think (and feel) about the work you do. If you are not happy with your job, if it is unfulfilling, uninspiring and unsatisfying, look to make changes that are more aligned with who you are, what you want to do and how you want your life to be. Don’t waste your time doing work that you don’t love as you can never succeed and feel truly fulfilled doing something that you don’t even like. When you love what you do, passion, creativity and dedication come easily when you love what you do."
"Find your passions, then pursue them."
