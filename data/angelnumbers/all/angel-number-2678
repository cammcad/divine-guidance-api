"Angel Number 2678 brings a reminder that your material wants and needs will always be met and your endeavours will reap both personal and financial rewards in your life, so do not live in fear of lack or loss. Balance your spiritual life with the monetary and physical world and this will see an increase to the flow of material abundance, as well as a sense of inner-peace and joy. With this increase to your prosperity, be mindful that the more you have, the more you have to share. Use your abundance wisely and nurture yourself and others with love, kindness and compassion."
"While helping others, remember to keep your own personal boundaries in place. Good, healthy boundaries are important to spiritual growth as you are actively taking responsibility for yourself and being wise with your own energy flow. Set healthy priorities and be true to yourself and honest with others. Love and nourish yourself by doing what you want to do, rather than what others want you to do, as when you love who you are you instinctively bring out the best in yourself and will find more positive ways to fulfill your needs and express your true self in all ways."
