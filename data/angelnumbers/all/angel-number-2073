"Number 2073 is a compilation of the energies and influences of number 2 and number 0, and the attributes of the mystical number 7 and the creative number 3. Number 2 relates to service to others, finding balance, encouragement and support, insight and love, faith and trust and serving your life purpose and soul mission. Number 0 stands for potential and/or choice, developing your spiritual aspects, listening to your intuition and higher-self, eternity and infinity, oneness and wholeness, continuing cycles and flow, and the beginning point. Number 0 powerfully amplifies the energies of the numbers it appears with. Number 7 resonates with persistence of purpose, faith and spirituality, introspection, learning and education, spiritual awakening, development, compassion, deep understanding, empathy and psychic abilities. Number 3 brings self-expression and communication, optimism and enthusiasm, natural skills and talents, friendliness and sociability, growth, expansion and the principles of increase. Number 3 also relates to the Ascended Masters, who act as mentors, teaching you the ancient wisdom involved in manifestation and manifesting your desires."
