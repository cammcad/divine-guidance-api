"Number 2073 is a compilation of the energies and influences of number 2 and number 0, and the attributes of the mystical number 7 and the creative number 3. Number 2 relates to service to others, finding balance, encouragement and support, insight and love, faith and trust and serving your life purpose and soul mission. Number 0 stands for potential and/or choice, developing your spiritual aspects, listening to your intuition and higher-self, eternity and infinity, oneness and wholeness, continuing cycles and flow, and the beginning point. Number 0 powerfully amplifies the energies of the numbers it appears with. Number 7 resonates with persistence of purpose, faith and spirituality, introspection, learning and education, spiritual awakening, development, compassion, deep understanding, empathy and psychic abilities. Number 3 brings self-expression and communication, optimism and enthusiasm, natural skills and talents, friendliness and sociability, growth, expansion and the principles of increase. Number 3 also relates to the Ascended Masters, who act as mentors, teaching you the ancient wisdom involved in manifestation and manifesting your desires.\t\tAngel Number 2073 encourages you to look to creative and inspirational ways to get your message across, whatever that message may be.
