"Angel Number 2799 brings a message to look to your daily habits and patterns, and assess how they serve you in your life. Our habits represent the little things we do throughout the day and also represent how we live our lives. The way we do things, no matter how insignificant they may seem, has a ripple effect throughout every aspect of our life. Our lives directly represent our inner-world and what we think about, comes about. Habits become entrenched and become part of who you are and how your life works. Make sure that your habits represent your true self and serve you (and others) in positive and meaningful ways."
"If there are unfinished projects that you started long ago (or even last week) now is a good time to work on and/or finish that project, or decide that it is definitely not something you wish to pursue. Either way, do not leave things pending. Teamwork may be required to complete a project or long-term goal."
"“Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.”"
