"The attributes of the number 6 are truth, love and compassion, particularly focused upon family and home life."
"When the 6 and 0 combination presents repeatedly in your life, the Universe asks that you focus less on material aspects and financial issues, and look to a more spiritual approach to having your wants and needs met.Â  Simply hold faith, trust and gratitude, and be open to signs and new opportunities that will bring your material needs to you."
