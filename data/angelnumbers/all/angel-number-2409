Number 4 also resonates with the energies of the\tArchangels\t.\tNumber 0\tvibrates to the ‘God’ force and Universal Energies (or Source), and stands for potential and/or choice,\tdeveloping one’s spiritual aspects\t, eternity, infinity, oneness, wholeness, continuing cycles and flow, and the beginning point.\tNumber 9\tresonates with the\tUniversal Spiritual Laws\t, leading life as a positive example for others, compassion and empathy, benevolence and generosity, service to humanity and\tlightworking\t. Number 9 also relates to endings, conclusions and closure. \tAngel Number 2409 suggests that you have been receiving intuitive and\tangelic guidance\tabout your\tlife purpose\tthrough your thoughts, feelings, visions and urgings, and your angels ask that you trust these messages and take positive action. You may feel prompted to be of service to others and humanity as a whole, and you are encouraged to follow this path. You have all the skills and talents you need to fulfil your\tlightworking\tmission and only you can fulfil your spiritual destiny.\tAngel Number 2409 may also indicate that a cycle or phase is coming to an end, or it is time to be finished with a situation that no longer positively serves you. Do not feel fear as these endings and conclusions will lead to auspicious new beginnings and opportunities for you. As with all endings, it is the beginning of something new and as one door closes, another opens for you. Take the\tlessons\tfrom the experiences and use them to your future advantage, focus upon your goals, aspirations and\tlife purpose\t, let go of the old and prepare to step through a new door of opportunity.\tMake the effort to spend time alone with yourself and your thoughts and feelings as this allows your inner-self to come to the fore and your\tinner-wisdom\tto be heard, bringing clarity. Once you begin to see with clarity the things in your life that no longer serve you, the easier it will be for you to eliminate them from your life once and for all.\tNumber 2409 relates to\tnumber 6\t(2+4+0+9=15, 1+5=6) and\tAngel Number 6\t.\t*\tJoanne\t\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers\tBody And Soul~Mind And Spirit"
