"The phenomena of 'Number Sequences', sometimes known as '\tAngel Numbers\t' is becoming more and more prevalent day by day. Thousands upon thousands of people from all walks of life, from all parts of the world, and from every creed and religion, are reporting the phenomena of noticing particular number sequences on clocks, timers, car number plates, billboards, and from all kinds of sources.\tAccording to respected authors, therapists and spiritualists around the world, this phenomenon is occurring as a new \tSpiritual Awareness\t is taking place and gaining momentum on our planet. As a race, people are evolving on a Spiritual level, with the number sequences being 'messages' from a Higher Source.\tYour \tangels\t (and/or \tspirit guides\t) guide you through your thoughts, feelings, words and visions. They also show you ‘\tsigns\t’ - that is, things that you see repeatedly with your physical eyes. One of the signs is repetitive number sequences.\tAngels\t and those of the spiritual realm do their best to get our attention and to communicate with us. In this way, they help us heal our own lives. However, we often discount the signs that they give us, writing them off as mere coincidences or our imagination.\"\tYour \tangels\t often communicate messages to you by showing you sequences of numbers. They do this in two ways. First, they subtly whisper in your ear so that you will look up in time to notice the time displayed on the clock, or the phone number on an advertisement or something similar. The \tangels\t hope that you will be aware and acknowledge that you are seeing this same sequence of numbers, over and over.\tThe second way in which the \tangels\t show you meaningful number sequences' is by physically arranging for something like a car driving in front of you that has specific number plates, and hope that you realize that you are seeing the number sequence again. They want you to notice, then look into the messages further.\tWhen you notice a particular number sequence recurring for you, ask the \tangels\t what they are trying to tell you, and you will find that your \tangels\t will give you additional information. Monitor your thoughts carefully, and be sure to only think about what you want, not what you don't want.\tNumerology\t is a sacred science that has maintained its relevance from ancient to modern times. Numbers point out the importance of seeing ‘messages’ three- dimensionally, in order to show us the lessons, growth opportunities and guidance contained with each experience.\tAs you recognize and interpret the numbers around you, you may feel more connected to the \tangels\t. This connection allows the angels to open the door to an incredible connection that brings peace, hope and love.\tNumber sequence interpretation is an easy way to receive \tmessages from your angels\t. Numerals are everywhere, from digital clocks to license plates. Each number has a vibrational frequently relating directly to its meaning.\tThe \tangels\t always seek to give us \tguidance\t and answers. When they call our attention to number sequences, it is a positive sign of their devotion, love and power. When you notice a number sequence, listen to your \tangel’s guidance\t that comes through your feelings, visions and thoughts. The more you notice these signs, the more frequently they will appear in your life. Once you understand the ‘signs’ meanings and accept that they are not mere ‘coincidences’, but important and purposeful events and messages, you will experience a close and clear communication with your \tangels\t. You will discover spiritual signs and messages all around you, all the time.\tYou may also notice number sequences that signify things of personal significance, such as birth dates, anniversaries, telephone numbers etc. In these cases the \tangels\t are giving you an even deeper, pertinent and personal message.\tThe recurrence of number sequences is a subtle and constant reminder that something magical … something Divine is happening. When you see the number sequences (‘\tAngel Numbers\t’), acknowledge that the angels are telling you that you are on your true path, and say ‘Thank You’ to them for communicating with you.\tThe \tAngel Numbers\t are messages for us - best we heed them.\t\t\tJoanne\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t  -  The Vibration and Energy of Numbers\tBODY and SOUL – MIND and SPIRIT"
