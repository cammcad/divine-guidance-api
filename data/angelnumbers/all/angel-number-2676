"Angel Number 2676 tells of relationships, associations, connections and communication. Look around at those that you associate with regularly and decide if you have enough like-minded people with whom to share. If not, seek them out."
"If you are feeling uncomfortable, dis-respected and/or manipulated in any relationship, it is time to bring that behaviour to a halt. Take responsibility for yourself and refuse to accept the negative influences. Move away from the relationship/situation in any way available and re-centre and balance yourself. Self-respect is important, so spend time with people who respect, love and care for you and make every effort to avoid those who dis-respect you and drain your energies. Set healthy boundaries for yourself."
"Stay open-minded, open-hearted, and grateful for all that you have and count your blessings daily. Be caring, open and supportive of others and give your advice if asked, but do not encroach upon their decision-making. Help others by setting a positive example."
