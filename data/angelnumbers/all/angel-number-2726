No one knows you better than you do, so be true to yourself and do not worry about those who choose to judge you. Look at all aspects of your life and be true and honest with yourself. Questioning your life leads to making changes. This includes your relationships with your friends, family and associates. Our relationships reflect how we see and treat ourselves. You may find yourself questioning whether or not you are still compatible with your friends, and whether or not your relationships are healthy, loving, supportive ones. It may be that your changed self needs time to adjust before you can renew old friendships, or it could be that you will see that you have friendships that are no longer suitable or sustainable. The latter can be difficult to accept, but it is still a sign that you are on the right path.\tNumber 2726 relates to\tnumber 8\t(2+7+3+6=17, 1+7=8) and\tAngel Number 8\t.\t*\tJoanne \tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers"
