"The energies of the number 4 have to do with hard work, effort, stability and strong foundations. When a 4 and 0 combination presents, your angels wish to reassure you that you are well loved, supported and protected."
"They ask that you take a moment to bask in this unconditional love, as it will hold the answer to many of your questions and will help resolve and overcome any challenges ahead of you."
