"When a 6 and 4 combination presents, your angels caution you that your focus is too much on the material world.  They ask you to surrender your worries to them in order for them to be able to intervene on your behalf.  The energy of stress and worry repels the Universal energies of abundance and prosperity; therefore, your angels ask that you keep a positive frame of mind and an optimistic attitude to enable your angels to work their magic in your life."
