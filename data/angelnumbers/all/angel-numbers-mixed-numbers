"Part of working out what your Angel Number or repetitive number sequence messages may mean has to do with your own intuition and higher wisdom. If a meaning and/or message resonates with your soul you will instinctively KNOW it. If it definitely does not, you will know that also."
"Angel Numbers can appear in any sequence and often present as mixed numbers such as 4284, 1063, 5839, 1386 etc. The combinations are endless. These numbers can be looked at in a few different ways. Often the total of the number sequence is the key to your message/s. For example, a sequence of 1210 can be viewed as 1+2+1+0 = 4. In this instance the number 4 is the vibration of your angels’ message."
"The numbers can also be looked at as individual entities, each carrying it’s own unique vibration, message and meaning. In the above example, the numbers 1, 2, and 0 can be looked at individually with each separate number denoting a particular message or direction. (When a 0 appears it amplifies and magnifies the energies and vibrations of the number/s it appears with)."
"This is also most common with numbers that run in sequence, for example 1234. You can view the combination as 1+2+3+4 = 10 / 1 … with your main messages being conducive to the energies of the number 1, or you can look at the numbers as individual entities, with each one representing it’s own individual traits and attributes. This combination can also be viewed as ‘steps’ as the numbers run concurrently, indicating the progression or phases you have worked through (or with) throughout your life to date. In theory, you will have completed 1,2, 3 and 4, and are currently heading towards the number 5, which is to do with freedom and personal expression. When numbers run concurrently it is often an indicator of a person’s life path or phases."
"When deciphering your Angel Number messages and meanings, look to all the numbers individually as well as as a total. And trust your own intuition – always."
