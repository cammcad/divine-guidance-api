"When the 4 and 9 combination repeats, your angels are telling you that it is time to let go of a situation that has ran its course.  They wish to remind you that as one door closes, another one opens. You are asked not to exert your time and efforts on staring forlornly at the closing door, rather than looking forwards to the seeing what is behind the opening door.  The angels are helping you to open these new doors and to heal from any pain or sorrow that accompanies the transition that you may undergo."
