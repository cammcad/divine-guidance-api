"The combination of 5 and 9 repeating is an indication of sweeping changes and endings. Your angels ask you to let go of the 'old' and know that it has served a vital and important function during its time, but that time has now passed.Â  The angels want you to know that the 'new' is about to enter your life, and ask you to let the 'old' go with love."
