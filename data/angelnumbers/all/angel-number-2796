"Angel Number 2796 tells of assessing your relationships (of all kinds) and being honest with yourself about how healthy, loving and supportive they are. Nurture the relationships that resonate with you, and release those that drain and deplete you. Take notice when interacting with others and be open to feeling and acknowledging the energies that transpire. Be aware of the influences and intentions of others. Nurture your relationships with the people (and things) that matter most to you, and share your love and light with others."
"If you are feeling uneasy and/or unclear about a situation or relationship, look within to your true feelings and inner-knowing and trust your intuition. If something doesn’t feel right, it most likely isn’t. Trust yourself to know what is best for you."
"Expand your limited view or perspective of a present situation that may seem challenging. This may entail a willingness to look at different aspects of both yourself and your challenge. Be willing to release old ideas and beliefs to make room for new learning and expansion on all levels."
