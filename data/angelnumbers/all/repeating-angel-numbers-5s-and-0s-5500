"The number 5 has to do with moving forward, freedom and courage and your angels wish to prepare you for some upcoming life changes."
"The 5 and 0 combination is an important message that lets you know that your life changes are in Divine and perfect order.  Everything is moving along as it should on your life path, and you are asked to ‘go with the flow’.  There is no need to stress or be concerned at all, as all is going to plan."
