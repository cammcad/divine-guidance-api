Making changes can bring about fear of the unknown and you may be feeling apprehensive about losing something (or someone) or may fear ‘change’ in general, but trust that what may appear to be a loss today may turn out to be a gain tomorrow and will bring you long-term benefits on all levels. Allow your angels to guide you and remember that there is nothing to fear.
