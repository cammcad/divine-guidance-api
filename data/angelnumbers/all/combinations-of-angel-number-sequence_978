"The combination of 1’s and 9’s indicates that your goal is almost complete, or that you are coming to the end of a phase in your life. It is an indication that one door is closing and another is opening as a product of your positive thoughts, efforts and actions."
"The message of the 1 and 9 combination is to allow the 'old' to be released so it is able to be replaced with the 'new'. The angels ask that you not look upon the changes as a ‘loss’, but rather as a new beginning, opportunity or adventure."
