"If you have been feeling that some part of your life is ending, such as a relationship or job, then this number combination is validation that your feelings are correct.  Take it as forewarning and prepare yourself for the changes to come."
"The 7 and 8 number combination heralds positive news about forthcoming positive changes involving the completion or ending of an intense situation.  Things will begin to flow more easily in your life from now on.  This may be on a monetary and financial level."
