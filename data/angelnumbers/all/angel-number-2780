You need to decide what it is that you want, then visualize it. Hold steadfast to your goals and do not be distracted by thoughts of failure or perceived obstacles and difficulties. Nobody knows you better than you know yourself, so do not identify with other peopleâ€™s views and opinions. Trust your own inner-knowing and live your life accordingly.
