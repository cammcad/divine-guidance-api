It is wonderful if you are able to mould your passion/purpose into a profession and/or career, but your soul mission does not necessarily have to be what you do to earn a living. Your mission may not be what you do, but WHO you are.\tTo find your life purpose and soul mission, ask yourself:\t“What is my passion?”\t“What do I feel passionate about?”\t“What is it that I love to do, and what do I want to do with my life?”\t“What makes me happy?”\tYou will know your passion and purpose because they make your pulse race and heart sing.\tNumber 2080 relates to\tnumber 1\t(2+0+8+0=10, 1+0=1) and\tAngel Number 1\t.\t*\tJoanne Walmsley\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers"
