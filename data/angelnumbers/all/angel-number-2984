"Angel Number 2984 brings a message to consider how much energy you give to matters that are not really that important and discern where your priorities lie. Consider what you really want your life to look like and how you wish it to be. What are your passions and how can you incorporate them into your life? Listen to your heart and stop allowing insignificant things to consume and distract you from being and living in the present moment. Start being all that you can be and do not allow fear, doubt or procrastination to hold you back. Let them pass and continue building your dream."
"Work through any issues that leave you feeling drained, fearful or as though you have little self-worth or esteem, and allow yourself to be the person you wish to be. Create what you wish to achieve through self-belief, clarity and visualizations. If you are able to see it in your mind and feel it within you and integrate it into your senses, you can create and manifest it into your reality."
"Angel Number 2984 tells you to speak and live your truths with love and kindness and use your personal power to find contentment in your everyday life. Be authentic and true to yourself and live accordingly. Free yourself from othersâ€™ expectations and choose where and how your energy flows. Inspire others to follow their own hearts and uncover their own unique gifts and talents. Inspire others to live a great life, and live yours as a positive example. Be real, whether others approve or not. Rise up to your highest potential and shine your powerful and beautiful light."
