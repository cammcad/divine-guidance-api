"4's and 1's indicate that the angels are emphasizing strongly that you remain aware of your thoughts at the moment.  The angels counsel you to make a meaningful wish as you are now in a position where you are able to manifest your thoughts.  The 4 and 1 combination is a sign that your angels seek to help you to manifest your heart’s desire.  Your personal will and effort combined with the energies of your angels will bring about what you have worked so hard towards."
"411 indicates for you to ask your angels for some vital, additional information that you may need at this time, as your path may not be clear or apparent to you at this time.  Fear not though, as the Universe and your angels have a clear view of your life and life purpose and they know what it is that you seek.  Listen out for their answers as they present themselves to you."
"4 1’s (1111) which adds up to 4, indicates that your angels want you to ask them to become involved with manifesting, particularly when the manifesting involves your life purpose or giving service to the world."
