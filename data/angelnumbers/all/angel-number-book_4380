"Joanne Walmsley\t-\tSacred Scribes\t \tANGEL NUMBER BOOK (to come ...)\t\tWithin a few weeks of the first messages coming through, I began receiving messages and information about repeating number sequences and the spiritual meaning and message of each number.  I dutifully began writing down notes one by one as they were 'told' to me.\t\tThroughout the last 16 years I have gathered all the information to produce this site ... which is in no way near finished, and I work on it every day.\tI have been asked many times when I intend to publish into book form ...\t\tEach and every time I have looked into publishing the Angel Numbers into ebook and paperback formats, my angels tell me to 'wait for the right publisher' and I have been assured that in time this will happen.  I am waiting patiently but I am in no rush whatsoever. I receive many emails each day asking if there is a book available, and if so, where can it be bought.\tAnd the simple answer is that when the timing is right the 'right publisher' will present, and the book will then be published and readily available.\t\t(see: \tAttributes of the Numbers 0 to 10\t)\t \tand listen to your own intuition and inner-knowing, there would be no need for a guide or book or anything else as it would become intuitive knowledge. The numbers then become more personalized for YOU as it is you who is making the connection and receiving direct messages for your own situation, circumstance, life etc.)\t(... and y\tou can't get that from a book!!\t)\t\tBlessings, Love and Light,\t\tJoanne Walmsley\tSacred Scribes\tVictoria   Australia\tsacredscribes@gmail.com \t\tDonations / Gifts\t\tMy primary intention is to make inspiring and uplifting spiritual information freely and conveniently available to all who seek it.  Keeping it all running, however, does take up a great deal of my resources – time, energy and money.
