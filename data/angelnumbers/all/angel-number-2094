You need to decide what it is that you want, then visualize it. Hold steadfast to your goals and do not be distracted by thoughts of failure or perceived obstacles and difficulties. Trust that if you have the idea and the goal there is a way to achieve it, and the resources you need to achieve your goals will become available to you when needed.\tAngel Number 2094 may also be suggesting that it is time to let go of a situation that has ran its course, or it is time to be finished with a situation that is no longer positively serving you. Do not feel fear or loss as these endings and conclusions will lead to auspicious new beginnings and opportunities for you. As with all endings, it is the beginning of something new and as one door closes, another opens for you. Take the\tlessons\tfrom the experiences and use them to your future advantage and focus upon your goals, aspirations and\tlife purpose\t. Let go of the old and prepare to step through a new door of opportunity.\tTrust that you are right where you are meant to be at this moment, and this moment is a stepping-stone to the next. Be willing to devote time and energy towards achieving your goals and aspirations and make them a priority in your life.\tNumber 2094 relates to\tnumber 6\t(2+0+9+4=15, 1+5=6) and\tAngel Number 6\t.\t*\tJoanne Walmsley\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers"
