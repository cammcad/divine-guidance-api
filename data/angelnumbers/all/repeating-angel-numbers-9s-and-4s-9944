"When the 9 and 4 combination appears your angels are telling you that it is time to let go of a situation that has ran its course.Â  They wish to remind you that as one door closes, another opens, and the angels are helping you to open those new doors and help you heal from any pain or sorrow that accompanies the transition that you are now undergoing."
