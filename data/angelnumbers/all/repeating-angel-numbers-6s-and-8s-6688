"The 6 and 8 combination may be indicating that a material possession is about to leave your life.  If you do not intend to lose or sell anything in your material life, then make a point of changing your thoughts to alter this direction.  Take stock of all that you have as it may be implying that it is time to de-clutter your home (or life in general) and be rid of the old."
"If you are intending to sell or be rid of something material in your life, this number sequence is a sign that your wish is about to come true and your item will sell or leave your life quickly."
