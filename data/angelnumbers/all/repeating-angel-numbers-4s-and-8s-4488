"The message of the 4 and 8 combination is that a phase of your life is about to end.Â  You are asked to not feel fear or negativity, and your angels want you to know that as things change and shift around you, they are with you, helping to guide you to a new situation or position better suited to your needs, desires and soul purpose."
"You may also experience financial gain due to some past work or effort."
