As you grow in awareness you learn to\tdiscern\tand decide what serves your highest good and what does not. Each choice and decision has the power to help or hinder you on your path. Use your own intuition and inner-radar to discern what resonates with you and what needs to be released from your life. Trust yourself to know what is best for you and take action accordingly. Make sure that your\tchoices\tand actions represent your true self and serve you (and others) in positive and meaningful ways.

Trust that you have all the attributes needed to succeed on your chosen path, and be aware and alert to signs and synchronicities while listening to and following your own intuition as this will lead you to your soul’s desired outcomes and results. \tSeek out opportunities to practice compassion and unconditional love for yourself and others.\t\tNUMEROLOGY\t -  The Vibration and Energy of NUMBERS"
