Number 4 also relates to the energies of the\tArchangels\t.\tAngel Number 2424 tells you to be patient a little longer as parts of the bigger plan need to fall into place so that the right doors of opportunity present at the exact right time. Rather than jump at the first thing that piques your interest, wait for clear and obvious signs that will guide you in the right direction. Do not be too hasty when making choices and decisions that will have long-term impacts on your life. Think through possible scenarios and outcomes and pay attention to your emotions as your feelings will clearly indicate which choices to make. Trust your intuition and you will know which path to take. Trust yourself to continue on your current path, but only if that path feels totally right to you on all levels. If not, change paths now.\tAngel Number 2424 brings a message to consider all of your options and weigh up what is truly important to you, and what is not. Do not waste your time and efforts on activities or people that do not support you or bring you joy, but rather, choose to spend your time doing things and spending your time and efforts on things (and people) that suit your true self and that resonates with your\tlife purpose\tand\tsoul mission\t.\tIf you are intuitively prompted to begin or expand a\tspiritually-based practice\tor service-based venture, trust that all will fall into place for you and you will find opportunities and assistance with establishing the foundations that will lead to your desired result. Have faith and trust that your hard work (in whatever way) will bring rewards.\tNumber 2424 relates to\tnumber 3\t(2+4+2+4=12, 1+2=3) and\tAngel Number 3\t.\t*\tJoanne\t\tSacred Scribes\tNUMEROLOGY\t- The Vibration and Energy of Numbers\tBody And Soul~Mind And Spirit"
