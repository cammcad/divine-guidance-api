"The 8 and 5 number combination signifies that you are heading towards substantial changes in your life.  The message from your angels is to remember that you are well loved and supported by the Universe, and to remind you to hold onto your faith and trust.  Some restraints may be shed to enable a promotion or advancement of some sort."
"The number 8 has to do with the energies of  authority, tenacity, wealth and abundance.  The number 5 has to do with personal freedom and expression.  Use the combined energies of these two numbers to your advantage."
