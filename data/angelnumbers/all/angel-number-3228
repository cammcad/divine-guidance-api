"Angel Number 3228 tells of giving and receiving and brings the energies of abundance and joy. The more you have, the more you have to share with others, be it your resources, knowledge and wisdom, time, efforts, finances, or anything else that you have in abundance. The energy you put out to the Universe is returned to you in kind. Selflessness brings fulfilment in profound ways and when you focus your energies on what you can give, rather than on what you can get, miracles happen. True abundance comes into your life in both seen and unseen ways."
"Angel Number 3228 brings a reminder that abundance comes in many forms such as good health, material wealth, time, knowledge and wisdom, love, family, friends, pets, plants, and all that brings joy and fulfilment to your life. Send out the energies and vibrations that you wish to receive in return. The greatest gift of abundance comes in the form of unconditional love. If you wish for kindness, joy and love, then sow seeds of kindness, joy and love. It is the Law of the Universe that you reap what you sow."
"Believe in yourself and encourage, support and empower others. Strive to be a shining beacon of light."
