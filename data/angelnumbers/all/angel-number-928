"Angel Number 928 encourages you to have a good think (and feel) about the work you do. If you are not happy with your job, if it is unfulfilling, uninspiring and unsatisfying, look to make changes that are more aligned with who you are, what you want to do and how you want your life to be. Don’t waste your time doing work that you don’t love as you can never succeed and feel truly satisfied and fulfilled doing something that you don’t even like. When you love what you do, passion, creativity and dedication come easily. Find your passions, then pursue them."
