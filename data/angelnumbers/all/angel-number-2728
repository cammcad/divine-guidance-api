"Angel Number 2728 tells you that if you wish to find success (in any field or endeavour) you need to start with your goals firmly and clearly in your mind. Decide what it is that you want, then visualize it. Hold steadfast to your goals and do not be distracted by thoughts of fear or failure. Do what suits you and don’t try to always please others as this is exhausting and depleting, particularly when it leads to you living a life based upon what you think you ‘should’ do, rather than on what you know you want to do and who you want to be. Do not gauge your own self-worth through the eyes of another. See and appreciate the value of your own existence. If you have the idea and the goal there is a way to achieve it, and the resources you need to achieve your goals will become available to you when needed."
"We are often tested by situations and circumstances that are beyond our control. Although you cannot control what is going on outside of you, you are in control of how you react and act. Your thoughts and actions have consequences, both good and bad. Your actions too will either yield positive or negative circumstances and/or consequences. Choose wisely."
"If you are feeling inclined to study a topic of interest, or pursue a course or line of education, now would be a wonderful time to look into your options."
