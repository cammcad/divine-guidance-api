"Angel Number 2836 tells you not to fret about the future or allow any negativity to reign in your life. Regardless of what may be happening around you, remain calm and balanced within and stay away from drama and negativity. At times, life can be difficult and may appear stressful or dull. Situations can then quickly become overshadowed by fear or worry, and your connection to joy is weakened. If a situation seems overwhelming and too difficult to solve or overcome, step back in order to gain a new and/or different perspective. Give yourself the opportunity to see things with fresh eyes, and take an intuitive and discerning look at all angles of the situation. Look for alternative solutions to lifeâ€™s challenges and trust that you have it within you to overcome and learn from each and every experience."
"Angel Number 2836 may also be suggesting that it would be wise to observe the actions of others rather than their words at this time. See what lays beneath the surface and listen to what is really being said. Observe what and/or who needs help and attention, or an answer or solution, and offer your assistance in your own heartfelt way."
"for your life, talents, gifts and abilities, possessions, health, family, friends and all that you have and are."
