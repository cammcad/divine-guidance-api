When experiencing loss or grief it can be difficult to recognize the blessings within the situation, but it is through facing adversity and living through our lowest points in life that we gain and allow for new-found strength and resilience to emerge. Without knowing loss we cannot appreciate gain. Without experiencing grief we are unable to appreciate love."
