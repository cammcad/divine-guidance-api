"Angel Number 2871 brings a message to look for clues and signs about what is happening in your life and act from your gut instincts and true feelings. Review how you are feeling at the present time. Are you comfortable and happy in your life, or do you feel that you are going against your own gut instincts? Open up the lines of communication between your heart and your mind and listen closely to your own intuition and inner-self."
"Angel Number 2871 can indicate that you may not be fully aware of all of the information, or something pivotal has not yet appeared or presented at this time. If feeling unsure of your next moves, step back and wait for further clarity. Trust that you will know more in short time and will be able to move forward with confidence."
"At times, when you know you need to, seek the guidance and advice of a trusted loved one or therapist/teacher. Ultimately though, you facilitate your own healing and problem-solving through a connection with your higher-self. Take on the advice of others, but use your own discernment when making choices and decisions. You already know within what is right for you."
"Angel Number 2871 also tells you not to feel dejected if things do not turn out as expected or as you had desired. What can appear to be a set-back can turn into an important and pivotal stepping stone. Sometimes, periods of difficulty and crisis are simply opportunities in disguise."
