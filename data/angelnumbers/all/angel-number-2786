"The Universe sends you challenges to test how you respond. We all face obstacles, challenges and tests throughout our lives, and although you may not be in control of what is going on outside of you, you do have control over how you react to those situations. These are spiritual tests for you to pass and it is up to you to prove that you are able to respond positively and handle the responsibility. The Universe sends more challenges and opportunities for growth, if you choose to accept them. If you rise with integrity to the challenge, your spiritual progress will be advanced and enhanced. Release the need to react in a negative manner and learn the lessons of being responsible for your own actions and reactions. Do not compromise your personal truths, but be completely honest with yourself and others at all times."
["Angel Number 2786 also brings a reminder to be grateful for your blessings.","and","is simply a matter of recognizing and acknowledging something ‘positive’ and consciously being thankful for it. This in itself promotes more positive energies and experiences."]
